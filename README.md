# An ASN.1 Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules encoding for Namecoin data

## Usage

An `ncasn.Zone` object represents a single name in the d/ namespace, containing a slice of `ncasn.Record`s as well as WHOIS data. Zones can then be serialized into ASN.1 UPER through `ncasn.MarshalRecords()`. For encoding efficiency, some records make some reasonable assumptions (mainly involving restricting certain insecure record data), which are documented through comments.

## Efficiency

Storage usage was benchmarked against proposed [Tor CAA](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/343-rend-caa.html) and [IETF CBOR DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lenders-dns-cbor) standards as well as [the JSON-based Namecoin format](https://github.com/namecoin/proposals), based on a sample of private DNS zones and (in much larger numbers) the Namecoin blockchain, the blockchain dumping and benchmarking code can be found in the `benchmark` module.

### Caveats

Some (hopefully reasonable) assumptions had to be made in order to achieve good coverage of the data, specifically, some record types had to be encoded in unspecified ways in some formats. For example, IPNS records are encoded as the raw key bytes in CBOR, and textual representations were used in the Tor format. Some record types were still excluded entirely (e.g., Namecoin `import`s), but did not meaningfully affect the results (see below).

### Results

These numbers are subject to change (hopefully improve!) as the format is updated and the benchmark may have to be tweaked, but the following comparisons to different formats can currently be made (as a ratio with our storage usage as the denominator):

```
Format: Size ratio | Record coverage | Record count
JSON: 4.28 | 1.00 | 233598
Tor: 1.77 | 0.89 | 207121
CBOR: 1.20 | 0.98 | 228794
```
